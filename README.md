# professional-portfolio

A portfolio for full stack web developer Mac Schmitz

## Description

I have created a professional portfolio to showcase my web development work. It is meant to show my current understanding of HTML and CSS. I have a working nav bar and basic site layout with a contact form, and have created a responsive design with media queries and flexbox. I also added hover effects to the image cards. This is a work in progress that will be developed more in depth as I progress through the bootcamp.
